## Customization

### Theme Colors
The app uses a purple-based theme. To customize colors, modify the `ColorScheme.fromSeed()` in `main.dart`:

```dart
colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
  seedColor: const Color(0xFF6750A4), // Change this color
  brightness: Brightness.light,
),
```

### Fonts
The app uses Google Fonts (Poppins). To change fonts, update the `textTheme` in `main.dart`:

```dart
textTheme: GoogleFonts.poppinsTextTheme(), // Change to your preferred font
```

## Testing

The app includes comprehensive error handling and loading states. Test the following scenarios:

- ✅ Adding tasks with and without descriptions
- ✅ Editing existing tasks
- ✅ Marking tasks as complete/incomplete
- ✅ Deleting tasks via swipe gesture
- ✅ Network connectivity issues
- ✅ Empty state when no tasks exist
